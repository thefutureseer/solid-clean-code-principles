# SOLID Clean Code Principles
## Examples in Javascript and Python

## Introduction
The **SOLID** principles are five fundamental design principles in **object-oriented programming (OOP)** that help create more maintainable, scalable, and flexible software. Following these principles improves code readability, reduces tight coupling, and makes software easier to extend and maintain.

## SOLID Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
**"A class should have only one reason to change."**  
Each class should have only one responsibility or function. This helps in maintaining a clean and modular design.

### 2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
**"Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension, but closed for modification."**  
New functionality should be added by **extending existing code**, not modifying it.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
**"Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering behavior."**  
A subclass should be able to replace its superclass **without breaking functionality**.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
**"Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use."**  
Large interfaces should be split into **smaller, specific interfaces** to prevent unnecessary dependencies.

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
**"Depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations."**  
High-level modules should depend on **interfaces or abstractions**, not on low-level implementations.

## Benefits of Using SOLID Principles
✅ **Improved Code Maintainability**  
✅ **Scalability & Extensibility**  
✅ **Better Code Readability**  
✅ **Easier Debugging & Testing**  
✅ **Reduced Coupling Between Components**
